# CONCLUSION:  
# Literature is just a pawn to be manipulated in your noble political world.
# Can you spare a field that should be blossoming?
# Why must literature, born of multiple values, bow to a single value?
# The Nobel Prize has its own values, that's your business.
# Literature doesn't exist to serve your shitty politics.
# Literature exists because it prides itself on not needing to mean anything.
# If literature has to serve one right.
# I hope literature dies today.
