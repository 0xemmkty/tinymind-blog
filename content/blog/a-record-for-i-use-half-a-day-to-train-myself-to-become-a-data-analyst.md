hi now is 5:20pm(CT) i have a interview tomorrow morning but you know i never ever try anything related to data analyst before and i never know why they give me a zoom link to interview thats funny. ok never mind. Let's begin!!! here i will show you how to use chatgpt and my nonsense talktive brain to prepare for tomorrow.    
i dont really intersted in this job since it is hybrid i hate onsite but anyway its fun to try i extremely appreciate it do not have too many tickle question before interview i like this!
   
First i check the job describtion: ok it not too difficult ok!
they are:   
- 1. collect, clean, oganized data, analyze big dataset
- 2. data visualization (PowerBI)
- 3. things i should familar(idk now): python, R, SOL, excel, KPIs, ad-hoc data analysis  
  
some notes i think i want to ask in the interview: 
- 1. remote? onsite? (when)  <- this is important bc i should buy a car or not
- 2. job content/tasks/meeting  
  
  
HI, i take a break to somewhere and now i return here, now is 9.26pm. we hope we can still finish this part :3 tonight
