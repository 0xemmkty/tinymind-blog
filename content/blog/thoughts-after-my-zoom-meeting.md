i find that i do not like to talk in the group meeting and more prefer to mute and just listen to others talking while i was maybe read sth else.  
i am think of some reasons:  
  
i think the most important reason is/was: 
- There is a mismatch between the speed at which humans speak and the speed at which I receive (perceive) sound. i was extremely impatient with single tasks, i can only do mutiple tasks.
- My language system doesn't match the human language system. The information density of what people are saying is so sparse and the amount of information I need to take in per unit of time is so great that I have trouble concentrating on them (my understanding is my adhd but I don't think it is, I don't have trouble concentrating, I have trouble concentrating on conversations that are too slow/too little information)  It's pretty obvious that I'd rather talk to a gpt than a human LOL    
- similar reason like above: I don't like communicating things to most humans (who don't have enough logic, and grasp the essence of things), I think it's a waste of time because what most humans explain in 1 hour can be read in 5-10min. And I can automatically form better logic in my head  (THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT bc this is why i always cant listen to teacher)
- My mind will always run much faster than a person can talk. And I consider talking a waste of my time. 

if the things i already know:
