:3  
do not have time to finish now, some note:
- spiritual and material needs  (or say pursit for emotion or power ) why people in opposite position
- humanity and science and human, why opposite
- are people really alienated or did the alienated come up with this theory  
what i want to express is to understand different people's position and perspective to enrich cognition
