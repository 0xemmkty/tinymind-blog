i was sorting out my clothes today and i feel really frustrated  
so i have a great(?) idea now? to create a app to manage this and other things:  
goal: minimalist way + layout + logic, to support mini time use and mini energy consume to max the output

some basic ideas  

* ## stuffs management  
  - ### clothes  
    - classification
    - photo upload + word describe
  - ### food/products
  - ### stuffs(items)
* ## tasks management
   - ###   
  
  
home page: tree type layout shows above all option, like linux
