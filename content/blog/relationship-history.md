hi my wifi suck today, so i am writing this LOL  
ohh my wifi suck due to my roommate forget auto pay, she is so cute :3 so not a big deal    
ok then we start:   
(they were my all "friends" and all my interactions, yes i only recognize very few friends)    
i dont like "many people"(i mean let many people know me), bc when i want to secretly leave a environment this will be more convinent :3  
AND i dont like to make (deep) connection with others  
OR SAY i dont really interested in human's relationship base on "need", i am always seeking relationship that go beyond need, which is base on "appreciation" between two complete mutare individual
