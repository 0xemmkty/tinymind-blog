and i failed   
bc i am so stupid  
so stupid for why i am here.  
bro ...........  
hiii, this is i forgot my name, i am so happy here to let you see my i dont know what i am doing, but i am cute :3   


ok, seriously begin:  
today i received a OA invitation and i am so excited because this OA they say is really hard and only very small numbers of people get this OA and this company is really hard to get in but you know this means this company has many many talented people. i am/was so excited for this and i means i really want to treat this opportunity seriously.  
todays afternoon i did some research on this company(dont ask me why please!!!! only for fun hehe i have this kind of hobby ;>) and i almost search all info online including what kind of people are now working here and yes ofc i found incredible numbers of talented people with amazing projects. all the things i want to say is, why, why this company choose me?????? thats insane. my resume or say my experiences are so normal among them ..... so why me ....... i cant understand. one of my guess is, maybe because of my major??? bc when i search their job description, i found a sentence: "_this company is build by a web developer and a philosopher_"(i can remmember all but it may like this) and i really like there is another sentence: "_It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us; what matters is that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university Teaching Assistant, switched to computer science recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem._ "  
really i love this company at least the first see.  
  
  

okok lets enter more direct part:
i need to prepare for OA, but i want to playfully put my ideas or thoughts here in unorganized way. i dont really care if this will cause only myself know what i am doing hehe. you know it just fun :3

this is a dp question  
good subsequence:  for example, 
Why dp[i][j] Works:
Each time we add a new character type (e.g., moving from i - 1 to i), we need to decide:
1. whether to include the new character in subsequences formed so far.
2. how many times to include it (up to its frequency).
dp[i][j], i means character type, in "abba", i is from 0 to "a" to "a b";  
dp[i][j], j means when only incluse "i", "i" appear how many times. in "abba", dp[1][1] means only incluse "a" and "a" appear once, which is "a" and "a", so dp[1][1] =2  
  
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] (init)
count of subsequences from the previous state dp[i - 1][j] without adding the new character type i.
dp[i][j] represents the number of subsequences using the first i character types where each character has exactly j occurrences.
By initializing dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j], it means we initially assume that adding the i-th character type does not change the count of subsequences for this frequency j.
if j>0, 
in "aab", dp[2][1] = dp[1][1] = "a"(1st) "a"(2) = 2
