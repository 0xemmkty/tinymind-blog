and i failed   
bc i am so stupid  
so stupid for why i am here.  
bro ...........  
hiii, this is i forgot my name, i am so happy here to let you see my i dont know what i am doing, but i am cute :3   
  

ok, seriously begin:  
today i received a OA invitation and i am so excited because this OA they say is really hard and only very small numbers of people get this OA and this company is really hard to get in but you know this means this company has many many talented people. i am/was so excited for this and i means i really want to treat this opportunity seriously.  
todays afternoon i did some research on this company(dont ask me why please!!!! only for fun hehe i have this kind of hobby ;>) and i almost search all info online including what kind of people are now working here and yes ofc i found incredible numbers of talented people with amazing projects. all the things i want to say is, why, why this company choose me?????? thats insane. my resume or say my experiences are so normal among them ..... so why me ....... i cant understand. one of my guess is, maybe because of my major??? bc when i search their job description, i found a sentence: "this company is build by a web developer and a philosopher"(i can remmember all but it may like this) and i really like there is another sentence: "It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us; what matters is that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university Teaching Assistant, switched to computer science recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. "  
really i love this company at least the first see.
