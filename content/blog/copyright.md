i came across a website today bc i was searching a short novel and there was a sentence on the home page of that website:  

**"Prohibited for those who do not support copyright."**   
  

my opinion is, i do care abt my copyright, i am willing to let everyone use my works, but i extremely appreciate this sentence and this website and I LOVE THIS.
i think, copyright exit in every artists heart, let them decide what they want to have this or not instead of the whole rule or others to determind
