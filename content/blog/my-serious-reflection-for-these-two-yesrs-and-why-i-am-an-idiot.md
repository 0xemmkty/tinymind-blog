hi.

i read someone's post today which is(was) really meaningful for me.  
it do(did) really change my recent life forcus or say it affirms my recent thoughts ... about underlying principles, first Principles, the essential logic of things, and why I think i've made a big mistake these last few years by rushing into things
I wasn't cool and calm and thoughtful enough. not analyzing the big picture enough. Falling into the trap of impatience and never think twice.
