very funny  
i bc of do not want to return to others, I avoid accepting any kind of help that would require me to return a favor. very funny logic you know lol  
therefore i either have no friends (don't want to make them) or only have friends who are full enough personalities to not need me to do anything for them  
I despise any relationship based on needs and desires.  
if i find that i am in a situation really need others help i will choose to get rid of that situation immediately. i dont like the weak's "save" each others's type relationship. i only respect mutual appreciation between two separate individuals  
  
i write this because i sudden think of i maybe do not have friends? or say the friends i will want to contact forever?
