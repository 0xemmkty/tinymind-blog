i regret study cs in college  
I wonder what would have happened if I had studied math and physics instead of computers science as an undergraduate.
I regret doing computer science, it's a boring, simple (without any logical in-depth training) subject  
  
i dont know what i want to say here, i think i have wasted my all college life with computer science LOL  
i have tried unity to make a game, but that is boring  
i have tried making web/product, but all are so boring  i mean too easy to finish do not have even a little bit chanllage LOL
I'm not interested in bits and pieces of knowledge in other field in cs  
I like pure logic  
You asked me what my favorite thing about computer science is.
My favorite thing about computer science is leetcode LOL  
Embarrassing and ironic.  
Why isn't my major/knowledge in math?  
  
i am not saying cs is not fun, i just say cs is too easy. too easy to catch my attention
