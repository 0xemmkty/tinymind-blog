TBC
since 2 days ago i re watch The Founder of Diabolism and this give me a very good idea abt our conflict --- mostly is different Values and we almost use totally opposite perspective to view things.
i want to make overview for :

**1** why i choose to meet when i know i should do this and the mistake i make  
i know in her this stage what is her need, and i know that's sth i cant provide because that's sth i do not agree. so the smartest choice is actually do not meet at first tbh and this is the mistake i make here. sympathy, or say too soft hearted at that time and the next 1 year.  
this is actually not the wrong or right stuff, youk sometimes It's the complexity and the fact that it's not black and white that makes things meaningful

**2** what are the "different" and why

- values
- perspective/position
**3** the reason for first and second delete and why this is the must
