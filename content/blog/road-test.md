do you think i can pass my test when i only drive within 15 hours?  
who knows?  
but   we should at least try, right?
  

let's start:
- begin:   check the light(right, left, ), honk the horn   
reverse car: tell reverse to the left and turn right or another:  
               1. (shoulder) check right and left  
               2. turn on the light (reverse to the left then turn on left light)
               3. shoulder check and look at behind back stright for half car
               4. full lock to left, reverse, change to D, full lock to right, go
- middle:
stop sign: 
turn: slow down but not to zero, pass more then turn
left turn: green and yellow, should wait oppisite stright car.
right turn: red light can still turn but should treat as stop sign unless there is sign prohibit
