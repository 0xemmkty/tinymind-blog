do you think i can pass my test when i only drive within 15 hours?  
who knows?  
but   we should at least try, right?
  

let's start:
- begin:   check the light(right, left, )    
reverse car: tell reverse to the left and turn right or another:  
               1. check right and lef  
               2. turn on the light
