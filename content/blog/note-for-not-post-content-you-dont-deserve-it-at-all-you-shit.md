FIRST I hate and despise criticism  
So SIMILARLY i hate and despise argue with others  
I never feel happy when i argue with you  
But i am annoyed and angry by a thought about”why only you can criticize others but others cant criticize you” and “I just think a lot of people's existence or a lot of reasons are being erased by you”   
So this is why this essay exist  
To show how i hate criticism and satirize it  
AGAIN criticism is shit!  
  
 ## **unfihish**



Bro, you said “everything is so shallow” in video  
I want to say “everything is so shallow” in your video  
To be fair, you were very arrogant, so I'll be very arrogant for matching your energy:  
It's disgusting. It's disgusting. absolutely disgusting  
You love mental illness?   
Ok fair i will use mental illness’s sensitive venting without fear and care and Ironize you, disgust you, against you only because you love this :3 self-righteousness, narcissism, inversion of black and white, recklessness to make you sick and i am so happy about this i am so happy to disgusted you because you like this what’s wrong with me you knowk i am your fav mental illness you must love me so much what’s wrong with me i just make sensitive reflection here LOL  
None well-adjusted is more sensitive? Bro ... are you insulting your noble brain to show how shallow and inexperienced and cognizant you are? Bro .... you did a good job omg so funny
What do you want to see here bro you are killing my existence how fucking wonderful you are omg i respect your stupidity is so perfect no one else could reach this level congratulations on your easy first place.  
You love reflect and sensitive?   
What about i have reflected and think your reflection is shit and ignorant and arrogant
What about my sensitive to the fact that your sensitivities are shit and ignorant and arrogant

Seriously, is this your ability to reflect? Is this your result after your reflection? TOTALLY AUTHENTIC SHIT why do you love my name so much funny You're in such a hurry to steal my name  
TBH A very shallow and limited and shit reflection  

Really, you use your own experience and with your self-centered feelings, in this case, what is the difference between you and the “normie” in your mind? ALL YOU ARE THE SAME IN MY EYES. See, no body choose or have ability go beyond the “world you know/see/perceive” to analyze why they are different and what makes them different. everyone observes the world from their “own perspective” and draws their own conclusions. How can these two groups understand each other? All the thing is “i feel” and final limit to “i feel”  


  
  
  
  
  

    


    
    


    



24:45  “world is flat” “the way interaction go”    
Ok, what is “world” here mention about? The actual world? The world you perceive? This is funny here, every “world’ perceived by a person is limit, which can means -----  
1.The world is flat? Nooo bc your circle or say the world around you that you can reach is flat, which means this (your)world is not “the world”  
2.The world is flat? Nooooo this only bc you is flat and boring enough to cant to make world full of variability  
3.The world is flat? Noooo this only bc you can never have chance to access to interesting people and so you think they do not exist  
4.The world is flat? Noooo, everyone who worser than you is the normie in your eyes, everyone who better than you is exploiting you  
5.The world is flat? Noooo only because you cant understand the things beyond your limit and unfortunately your limit is so flat enough to meet flat world  
See all the things are your imagination   


29:18 “political orientation, (related to ) existential orientation, aesthetic orientation”
See gpt record  
  

30:45? “apolitical: right wing or afraid of conflict bala bala”  
I think it's disgusting here Very arrogant in fact. Or maybe very narrow minded, it's hard to describe and gives me a sense of imagining the world in terms of self-centeredness (this is my most annoying point of the whole piece)  
Despite emphasizing at the beginning of the video that it doesn't resent the world, the fact is that the projection and hostility is very obvious  
It just like kill many many possibility  
I don't think I'm strictly apolitical it seems more like anti-political, but for what it's worth, I think politics is dirty and inherently manipulative, (i dont even like the writing style in politics). As it says here “afraid of conflict” but the truth is, I'm deliberately avoiding conflict. I don't like the “purpose” in politics, and I hate it when people who study politics unconsciously speak with superior personal “values” and unconsciously impose them on others. I hate the way they see the world and assume that everyone is like them and so if others don't study only because they have a vested interest.  
Fear of conflict is fun here, because conflict is created when one or both sides strongly defend their values, which requires a strong love or hate for something, but in my eyes, a strong love or hate is a manipulation in my mind.    
I happen not to think there is a right or wrong here, I happen to be saying there is no right or wrong here, I just think that if exploitation can be reflected upon, why doesn't manipulation need to be reflected upon.  
Actually, to simplify it even more, the logic behind both is the same to me, a process of having a need and then fulfilling it. It's just that for people, the needs are different and therefore perceived differently.  
And because in some ways I don't have a lot of emotional needs (or maybe there is no defects, I'm emotionally rich and I value my feelings and emotions very much and don't give them away easily), I'm very sensitive to emotional manipulation, for example people's passions for politics or the way they write about politics and incite crowds, or even Nietzsche's way of writing, or even criticism itself(idk i guess this explain why many people do not like critically engage, but here can be a reason) is a form of emotional manipulation for me. (Not means they did it on purpose)  
On the other hand, I'm not particularly sensitive to “exploitation” from a material point of view (for example, job). easy to infer the reason  
  


Why people should have justification? Why people should criticize things? What about their justification is criticize your critism  
This is extremely funny  
What is the difference between a person who has never thought about why they accept and a person who has never thought about why they criticize. It's the same.  
  


Argue and dont argue bc avoid conflict: funny. I hate argue. Waste of time and energy LOL
Sorry we dont argue bc 1. these such boring things do not deserve any of our strong hate and love  2.   
  

Normie part: everyone who worser than you is the normie, everyone who better than you is exploiting you.  

  

How are you going to argue that it's not because you're narcissistic, it's normie thinking skills that don't work. How are you going to argue it's not because it's you being a piece of shit  

I don't want to talk to you because it's very emotionally draining.  
But I think you deserve to hear something different.  
Regardless of the rights and wrongs and consequences.  
  

My political position is anti political. Do you think anti political is political-orientation  
I admire elon musk  

Nietzsche’s writing style is a example of emotional manipulation,  
  

Your criteria in turn are mine.  
- i hate online people
- i dislike queer people: only normie care about gender stuff
- i hate mental illness people:annoying 
- i disgust none well-adjusted people: annoying 
- I despise Marxist
  

AGAIN  
I don't want to talk to you because it's very emotionally draining.  
I dont want to post this now  
Disgusting euough to do no deserve my any emotion at all
