1. 沙白  
  
11.8  update
read others comment on her today:  
“She's been living in puberty and has never gotten out of it”  
i think this is a good comment, i dont think i dislike this kind of people? i think i just feel pity for them. I feel sympathy.  

2. someone share relationship story and i think abt (or say reflect) myself
