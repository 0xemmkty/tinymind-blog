high presssure environment is better for ADHDers?  
i read a post today and it make me think a lot and i want to say yes maybe this is true?  
i have experienced my middle school under "high pressure" environment and i think that period was the most productive period in my life. my high school is too loose and self-indulgent no need to mention my college life LOL i extremely regret for all the life after middle school fr fr.   
i dont know what to say, i extremely admire and respect my primary and middle school me.   
i think that i am different from my others people, i actually need and appreciate external pressure and only that can make me maximize my potential.  
i have a lot to say, but maybe not now. over all, i need high pressure environment and external force to "control" me.
