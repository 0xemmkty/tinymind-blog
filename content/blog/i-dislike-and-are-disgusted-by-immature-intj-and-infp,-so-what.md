mostly is abought Fi.  
i write this post and my opinion is not based on i have low Fi, instead i have strong Fi bc if not this post will never exist at all. i understand everyone have thier own growth road, and in each period different Fi will present different thing, but i do not want to change my opinion. (you know this is very Fi actually lol)  
   
### a quick note:
Fi+Te ---> to criticize others (and to do so in a self-centered way)   and very insecure, have to defend their values and prove they are right.  (lol I despise this behavior) 

unhealthy Fi(i know they will think this is healthy lmaoo): excessive self-consciousness, narcissism, It's all about how they feel, in any interaction you actually do not "exist" they never interested in how you feel the only things they want is their own satisfaction  

areas of high npd and bpd prevalence  
and high prevalence of emotional manipulation
