it is a little bit sad for read this message tbh .....
misinterpretation, distortion, projection, over-defense .....
K has changed a lot, to a very terrible direction ... i did want to stop this trend, but I realized I couldn't do anything but watch her develop. Anything I did would have backfired. It's sad, but it doesn't matter I accept it.

her change is predictble .... this pic is from our past discord(7/5/23)  
i am thinking abt: do you think i use "stupid" is wrong or too mean? emmm i try to think abt this, i certainly no need to find self-identity by attacking others, because firstly I really don't need to, and secondly the matter is none of my business. I was just trying to provoke her to see if she could think of one more possibility, but I think, judging by her reaction, she took it as an “attack”.  
i dont know, i do not feel angry or sth, i just feel sad. too see a person become like this is really sad .....
