it is a little bit sad for read this message tbh .....
misinterpretation, distortion, projection, over-defense .....
K has changed a lot, to a very terrible direction ... i did want to stop this trend, but I realized I couldn't do anything but watch her develop. Anything I did would have backfired. It's sad, but it doesn't matter I accept it.

her change is predictble .... this pic is from our past discord(7/5/23)  
i am thinking abt: do you think i use "stupid" is wrong or too mean? emmm i try to think abt this, i certainly no need to find self-identity by attacking others, because firstly I really don't need to, and secondly the matter is none of my business. I was just trying to provoke her to see if she could think of one more possibility, but I think, judging by her reaction, she took it as an “attack”.  
i dont know, i do not feel angry or sth, i just feel sad. too see a person become like this is really sad .....  
i am so sad .... i am so sad ... i promise i do not think you are stupid or want to express you are stupid .... i just want to i dont know ... how can i make you aware sth in your life ...   
sad and feel like yes i cant do anything ... i already know this day will come but when it truly come still feel sad ... but yes anyway this is always bad things, transition in a person's life will have many period, but just this period is almost most 'terrible' one for me to stand.  
so, i choose to leave. i think i only want to leave for short time but idk, this depends on the future.    
also, i am not say this "change" is not good, youk life is a long journey, maybe only this change can cause next change and then cause next change. we cant deny every "change", bc change, at least is changing, changing means hope and new.
  
someone says to me in the past, do not meddle in other people's destinies, bc first, probably they do not like you do this, they maybe hate you if you do this, not all people can tolerant this. second, you cant change others cause and result and it will probably get you involved in sth you should avoid, it maybe does harm to you. Third, why do this? you cant change anything and you know meddle in others destiny will waste your energy.  
From this perspective, only stupid people try to care abt others life, others cause and results. Thats so sad, i am stupid.   
  
I really love one day my convo with a person. i asked him, if you know you cant change anything and if you say this people will get annoyed at you, so why you still choose to give others suggestion?

beautiful and very brave.  
if you dont even do not need any return from a person when you help them, then there is nothing can hurt you.
