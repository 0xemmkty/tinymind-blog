I'm studying cognitive neurology, and I think it's fun now :3  
I don't want to say that the scientific brain is opposed to the artistic brain.  

I don't think there's a dichotomy between rigor and chaos.  

I've always loved the calm and analytical, neutral and objective for example math/science without any personal emotion  

I've also always loved the purity of literature and the arts, the complete blossoming of personal emotion/passion and desire.  

You see, I like pure reason and pure emotion/passion.  

On the contrary, I don't like sociology, politics, philosophy (anti-rational philosophy) because it's boring. The rational isn't pure enough, the emotional/passion isn't absolute enough, it's just mediocrity.  

A critic can never be a creator.
