my view so we should make agreement that all things below under these premises:
- 1. i am a chaotic evil (mostly not evil but i want to say yes yes i am evil and just think me as evil please i am not interested in let you say i am a good guy :3)  
- 2. I don't think I should have an absolute position. I don't think there is right or wrong in this world.
