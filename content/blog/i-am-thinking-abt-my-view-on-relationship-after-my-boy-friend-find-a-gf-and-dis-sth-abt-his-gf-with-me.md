he texted to me today
context:  
he: gf complaint me had too few experience intimate with girls  
he: ??? i should fuck more girls in her eyes? to gain more experience? in that case she will be more unhappy i bet this is true.... cant understand girls ...

and my thought:   
bro ...............
if i were you ...........
i definitly never ever meet / talk to this kind of people no matter gender .......  
  
really, i think this is self value stuff.  
he asked me what's wrong he did, i say too low self value, too like a dog to your gf ....  
(here i dont want to agrue that in what kind of situation become dog is cute, and in what kind of situaton become dog is totally stupid)    
  
***sorry, i cant understand why people like to have this kind of relationship and called it romantic relationship***  
***kill me please***  
"can you give me some suggestions for my relationship?"  
"you are too like a dog in your relationship ..... bro ...."
